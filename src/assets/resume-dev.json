      "description": "The radical change social media has brought to our information ecosystem has created one of the biggest problems our world faces today: misinformation. With economic, social, and political implications, researchers have directed their attention to ways in which this problem can be understood and solved. Recent work has shown that articles from misleading sources can be told apart from mainstream sources by the topology of their Twitter diffusion networks. This project expands on these findings by attempting to answer the question: can the diffusion networks of misinformation articles reveal a set of ways in which misinformation spreads on social media? To accomplish this, the Twitter diffusion networks of over 700 articles from low credibility sources were converted to embeddings using the UGraphEmb graph embedding algorithm and clustered using k-means clustering. From here the differences in topological features of diffusion networks belonging to different clusters will be analyzed and explained. The hope is to use these results to better inform social media policy and algorithm design. ",
